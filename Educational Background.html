        <p class="background-design">
        I went to Valenzuela National Highschool for my Junior Highschool. I was in a special program for 4 years. The special program is like STEM however there it was called STEP. 
        <br>
        STEP was an acronym for Science, Technology, and Engineering Program. It was a special course that required an entrance examination in order to get in. In that time the slot was very limited.
        <br>
        During my grade 7 to 8, those were the years that I had a hard time keeping up due to the tasks that they keep giving out.
        <br>
        Before the end of my grade 8 year, that was when the Pandemic hit so my grade 9th and 10th years were all online. With 2 months left
        <br>
        My batch were lucky to have a face to face graduation. I finished grade 7 to grade 10 in VALNAT.
